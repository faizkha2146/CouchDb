# CouchDB Architecture Documentation

## Overview

CouchDB is a distributed, document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data as JSON documents, supports powerful querying with MapReduce, and provides robust replication and synchronization features. This architecture documentation outlines the structural design, key components, and interactions within a CouchDB system.

## Components

### 1. Client Applications

- **Web, Mobile, and Desktop Clients:** Communicate with CouchDB via HTTP/RESTful API.
- **Libraries:** SDKs for various languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.).

### 2. HTTP API Layer

- **RESTful Interface:** All database operations (CRUD, replication) exposed as HTTP endpoints.
- **Authentication:** Uses cookie-based, OAuth, or proxy authentication.

### 3. Core Database Engine

- **Document Store:** Stores database records as JSON documents.
- **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control):** Ensures data consistency and enables conflict resolution.
- **Views and Indexes:** MapReduce functions for querying and indexing.

### 4. Storage Layer

- **B-Tree Indexes:** Efficient storage and retrieval of documents and views.
- **Append-Only File Storage:** Each change is appended, supporting reliability and crash recovery.

---

## Replication & Synchronization

- **Master-Master Replication:** Databases can replicate bidirectionally, supporting offline and distributed scenarios.
- **Conflict Resolution:** When conflicts occur, CouchDB stores conflicting revisions and lets applications resolve them.
- **Synchronization:** Via incremental replication between nodes.

---

## Security

- **Authentication:** Pluggable authentication modules.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control per database.
- **HTTPS Support:** Secure communication via SSL/TLS.

---

## Fault Tolerance & Scalability

- **Append-Only Storage:** Minimizes data loss.
- **Replication:** Enables redundancy and high availability.
- **Cluster Mode (CouchDB 2.x+):** Horizontal scaling via sharding and clustering.

---

## Data Model

- **Database:** A collection of documents.
- **Document:** A JSON object with metadata (`_id`, `_rev`).
- **Attachments:** Binary data (images, files) stored within documents.
- **Views:** Custom indexes powered by user-defined MapReduce functions.

---

## Typical Workflow

1. **Client sends HTTP request** (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to CouchDB.
2. **API Layer authenticates and processes request.**
3. **Core Engine updates JSON documents, indexes, and storage.**
4. **Replication synchronizes changes with other nodes (if configured).**

---

## Example Interaction

```http
POST /db
{
  "_id": "user:123",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

---

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Erlang
- **Storage:** Custom append-only files
- **HTTP Server:** Built-in (based on MochiWeb)
- **MapReduce:** JavaScript for view definitions
